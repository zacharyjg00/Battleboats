# Battleboats

This is **Battleboats**. It is a Battleships clone written in Java. You can choose to play in either standard or expert mode where ships are randomly generated and placed on the boards. It is your job to sink all of the ships in the least amount of turns and the least amount of shots possible.

**TODO:** 
- Refactor to reduce repetitive code
- Figure out a solution to deal with non-int inputs when the user is prompted for coordinates
- Add in the ability to store all hits, misses, and powers in an SQL database
